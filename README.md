# Quiz-App
 The project is an interactive quiz application featuring a Java backend and a graphical user  interface (GUI) built with Java Swing, adhering to Object‑Oriented Programming (OOP) principles

 ## Brief Description
This Java application offers a user-friendly interface implemented with Java Swing. It allows users to create and take quizzes, making it both a tool for learning and a fun game for challenging friends' knowledge. The app supports multiple-choice and true/false questions, and quizzes can be taken solo or with friends. No user data or scores are stored permanently, emphasizing the app's focus on immediate learning and entertainment.

## In-depth Description of How the App Works and Usage
After the application is opened, the user will be asked to sign in, but the data will not be retained in memory, as this is a one time use app. After you logged in, you can 
choose if you want to create a quiz or play one. Only two types of questions are supported by this quiz application, multiple choice questions with four answering options from which a single one is correct and true/false statements.  If you choose to create a quiz, there is no going back, and you need to finish the creation. When creating a quiz, you first need to input the name and topic of the quiz, 
these fields are required and they can’t be left empty, and choose the difficulty of thequiz. The options for the difficulty are: easy, medium or difficult.  After this step is done  you need to input the questions. There is no limit to the number of questions that can be added. You need to select the “add question” button from the bottom of the screen to be able to add a question, each time the user wants to introduce a new question, this button needs to be pressed. Now, from a drop down list, the user can choose if the next question to be added will be a true/false or a multiple choice kind of question. If the next question will be a multiple choice, the user will be asked to input the question, and then the options one by one, and in the end to input the index of the correct answer. When a true/false is introduces, the user only needs to write the statement and choose if it is true or false. When the user is done adding questions, the “done” button needs to be pressed and the user can choose what he wants to do next, he can either play, create more or exit. When the user wants to play, a quiz from the available quiz list needs to be selected. After the quiz is selected the user will need to decide whether the quiz will be played by only one user or the user will be joined by some other friends. If there will be only one user taking the quiz, there will be some buttons that need to be pressed to get to actually answering the questions, all the instructions are displayed on the screen, and then the after the quiz starts and the answers are submitted, a score will be displayed and then the user can play another quiz or exit  the application by pressing buttons. If the user chooses to play with some other friends it works like this: the main player( the one that started the game, the one that logged in first) needs add players, this happens by pressing the “add players” button from the bottom of the screen. Now the main user needs to add the players that will play along, the name and the age are required, and after inputting the name and age of the first player that joins, the button “submit+add more” needs to b pressed. Only after this button is pressed the data of the player is being processed. After all the players are added, the “done” button should be pressed, and then the quiz will start for the first player. The name of the player whose turn is will be displayed on the screen along with the quiz details. In order for the certain player to take the quiz, the button “Take quiz” should be pressed. After the player takes the quiz the button “ next player’s turn” should be pressed an the same will happen for each player until there are no more players and the leaderboard is displayed. If one player did not press “take quiz” button but pressed “ next player’s turn”, his score will be considered zero, and there is no other way of taking the quiz in the current session anymore. After the leaderboard is displayed, you can take another quiz or exit the application.
